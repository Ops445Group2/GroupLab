# Game Instructions
1) Player(You) VS AI <br>
2) Player will be prompted to choose one of the following three options: <br>
3) Options: "rock", "paper", "scissors" <br>
4) Note that game will keep asking player to choose if player doesn't choose one of the three options <br>
5) AI will randomly select one of the three options <br>
6) Game will compare player's and AI's option and determine the winner <br>
7) Game will display result, there are three possible results (Win, Tie or Lose) <br>
8) Game will ask player if he/she would like to play again <br>
9) If yes: player will be prompted to choose one of the three options <br>
10) If no: game ends <br>

# Algorithm
1) Define the rockpaperscissors() function which allows the user to choose their option.<br>
2) The rockpaperscissors() function will validate the user's input. The input has to be one of the three options (rock, paper, or scissors).<br>
3) If the user enters a valid input, return the user's input.<br>
4) If the user enters an invalid input, display an error message and prompt the user to enter the correct input.<br>
5) Define the outcome() function. The function compares the user's and AI's options to determine the winner.<br>
6) The outcome() function will return the output as a string.<br>
7) Define the game() function, which creates a list of 3 options ("rock", "paper", "scissors").<br>
8) The game() function will loop until the user decides not to play anymore.<br>
9) The game() function will call the rockpaperscissors() function to store the user's option.<br>
10) The game() function will call the outcome() function to determine the winner.<br>

# QA Testing
1. Run your game locally. If any errors, create an issue in GitHub.

```json
It not showing no errors
```
2. A new issue added comments for the developer to add a loop and exit statement dependingon if the user wants to continue to play another round or not.

3. Run the game and show that the game will continue or exit depending on the user response.

```
If user want to play agian they can type "YES" 
```
<img src="Outcome on the user response'YES'.jpeg"
     alt="Outcome on the user response'YES'"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

```
If user do not want to play agian they can type "NO" 
```

<img src="Outcome on the user response'NO'.jpeg"
     alt="Outcome on the user response'no'"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />


4. For the issue created, close it if successfully completed

# The Scope of the Project
Essentially the scope of the project is to develop a rock, paper, scissors game so the company that our team works for (Games4You) can sell the game to other companies. <br>
1) our team create a plan that provide instructions and algorithm to explain how the game works <br>
2) our team designs a flow chart which demonstrates the steps of a process <br>
3) our team developes the game, and ensure it has proper iterations and perform QA testings. <br>
4) the game is ready for deployment <br>
